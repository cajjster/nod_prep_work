# 🧠 Prep Work for Nod Coding Bootcamp 🚀

Welcome to the **Prep Work** for the **Coding Bootcamp** 🎓!  
The goal of this material is to ensure that **everyone starts the bootcamp on the same level** 💪.  
All exercises must be **completed before the first day** and will be **handed in when the bootcamp begins** 📅.

The prep work is divided into **three labs** 🧩, each containing a series of exercises:  
- The first two labs are designed to be solved **without example solutions** to test your problem-solving and persistence 🧠.  
- The final lab is more difficult and includes **example solutions** to help you check your progress ✅.

⏱️ Expect the prep work to take up to **40 hours** if you’re new to Python 🐍.  
If you already have some experience, it will be much faster ⚡.

🤖 **Important:** You may use ChatGPT *only as a last resort* — and if you do, make sure to **ask for explanations without revealing the answers**.  
The goal is to **learn by thinking and coding**, not by copying! 💡

## How to Make the Most out of the Prep Work 🏆

#### 💡 Learning by Doing: Experiment, Print, and Execute Your Code

When you’re learning to code, it’s completely normal to feel unsure about whether your solution will work. Many beginners write a few lines of code, stare at it, and guess what it might do. But that’s not how you actually learn programming.

The real learning happens when you run your code, observe what happens, and adjust.
Don’t try to get it perfect before pressing “Run.” 

Instead:

1. Execute often. Run your code after every small change. See what happens.

2. Use `print()` statements. Print out intermediate results to check your logic step by step. This helps you understand what your code is actually doing, not just what you think it’s doing.

3. Embrace errors. Error messages are your friends — they tell you exactly what went wrong. Learning to read and understand them is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.

To sum it up, you don’t learn to code by thinking about code. You learn to code by running code.
So be curious, experiment freely, and see your notebook as a playground for testing out ideas rather than a place for perfect answers.

Good luck and have fun preparing, see you at the bootcamp! 🚀🔥
