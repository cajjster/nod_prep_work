    "#### 💡 Learning by Doing: Experiment, Print, and Execute Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re learning to code, it’s completely normal to feel unsure about whether your solution will work. Many beginners write a few lines of code, stare at it, and guess what it might do — but that’s not how you actually learn programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real learning happens when you run your code, observe what happens, and adjust.\n",
    "Don’t try to get it perfect before pressing “Run.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute often. Run your code after every small change. See what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `print()` statements. Print out intermediate results to check your logic step by step. This helps you understand what your code is actually doing, not just what you think it’s doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embrace errors. Error messages are your friends — they tell you exactly what went wrong. Learning to read and understand them is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, you don’t learn to code by thinking about code. You learn to code by running code.\n",
    "So be curious, experiment freely, and see your notebook as a playground for testing out ideas rather than a place for perfect answers."

    "\n",
    "#### 🧑🏼‍💻 Combining Iteration, Control Flow and, Storage to Solve Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming problems can be boiled down to this: Going through a bunch of data, do stuff to the data (transform, manipulate, filter etc.) and storing your new result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break this down into the following actionable steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty list for the final results, the empty list will serve as a placeholder.\n",
    "2. Figure out what data you need to go through and write a loop that iterates over each element.\n",
    "3. For each iteration, do something to the data.\n",
    "4. For each iteration, append what you've done to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to solve every single question in this lab using the structure of this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are couple of examples that use this pattern to solve different problems."

    "## Q5 - Extracting Data from Server Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "You work as a junior backend developer analyzing server logs. Each log entry is stored as a tuple containing three elements: `(timestamp, URL, status_code)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager wants a list of messages summarizing each request in the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f\"At {timestamp}, the request to {URL} returned status {status_code}.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 20 log entries. Your task is to go through each tuple, unpack it into meaningful variables, and create the summary messages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Tuple Unpacking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking is a way to assign each element of a tuple to a separate variable in a single step. This is very useful when you have structured data like logs, coordinates, or any collection of fixed-size tuples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax in a loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for element in list_of_tuples:\n",
    "    var1, var2, var3 = element\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `var1` will get the first item of the tuple, `var2` the second, and `var3` the third. This lets you work directly with meaningful variable names instead of indexing each element manually (`element[0]`, `element[1]`, etc.).\n"
