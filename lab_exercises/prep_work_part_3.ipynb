    "## How to Succeed with these Exercises 🏆\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 Learning by Doing: Experiment, Print, and Execute Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re learning to code, it’s completely normal to feel unsure about whether your solution will work. Many beginners write a few lines of code, stare at it, and guess what it might do — but that’s not how you actually learn programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real learning happens when you run your code, observe what happens, and adjust.\n",
    "Don’t try to get it perfect before pressing “Run.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute often. Run your code after every small change. See what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `print()` statements. Print out intermediate results to check your logic step by step. This helps you understand what your code is actually doing, not just what you think it’s doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embrace errors. Error messages are your friends — they tell you exactly what went wrong. Learning to read and understand them is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, you don’t learn to code by thinking about code. You learn to code by running code.\n",
    "So be curious, experiment freely, and see your notebook as a playground for testing out ideas rather than a place for perfect answers."

    "\n",
    "#### 🧑🏼‍💻 Combining Iteration, Control Flow and, Storage to Solve Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming problems can be boiled down to this: Going through a bunch of data, do stuff to the data (transform, manipulate, filter etc.) and storing your new result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break this down into the following actionable steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty list for the final results, the empty list will serve as a placeholder.\n",
    "2. Figure out what data you need to go through and write a loop that iterates over each element.\n",
    "3. For each iteration, do something to the data.\n",
    "4. For each iteration, append what you've done to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to solve every single question in this lab using the structure of this pattern.\n",

    "Below are couple of examples that use this pattern to solve different problems. Run the code to see what the output is."

    "# Q7 - Cleaning Customer Feedback\n",

    "\n",
    "You have a list of 20 customer feedback strings. Your task is to create a cleaned version of each feedback string by:  \n",
    "1. Removing leading and trailing spaces.  \n",
    "2. Converting all letters to lowercase.  \n",
    "3. Replacing exclamation marks `!` with a period `.`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Hint: You will need to make use of three different string methods to clean the feedback. One for trailing whitspaces, one to replace charcters, one to lowercase characters."
